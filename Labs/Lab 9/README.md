We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

Once the code is written, I would go search for available domain names that fit my website, but are also cheap. Then I would use AWS to deploy my website because it has a free tier and is reliable. In order to put my website up, I would set up a container using Docker since it is somewhat of a standard in the industry. I would make sure to use HTTPS on my website for security, but I would choose not to add a web certificate so I can avoid blame for any problems that may occur.
